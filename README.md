# January 15th, 2024

The day began with the familiar comfort of my local caf√©, where I savored my morning coffee while watching the city wake up around me. The aroma and warmth provided the perfect backdrop for mentally preparing for what lay ahead.

Back at my desk, I dove deep into finalizing the presentation for tomorrow's meeting. The hours seemed to slip by as I refined each slide, balancing thoroughness with clarity. Despite my focus, I could feel a subtle undercurrent of nervous energy building.

When I needed a break, Central Park called to me. The weather was absolutely beautiful ‚Äì one of those perfect days that reminds you why you love this city. The fresh air and gentle movement helped clear my mind and reset my perspective.

Evening brought a delightful dinner with Sarah at that new Italian place we'd been wanting to try. The food was exceptional, and our conversation flowed as easily as the wine. It was exactly the kind of evening that makes you appreciate good food and even better company.

As the day winds down, I find myself in that familiar space of mixed emotions ‚Äì anxious about tomorrow's presentation but genuinely excited about the opportunity to share what I've been working on. Sometimes the best moments come from embracing both the nerves and the anticipation.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No notes are being processed**

- Verify API key is correct and has sufficient credits
- Test connection using the "Test AI connection" command
- Check network connectivity for cloud providers

**Ollama connection issues**
- Ensure Ollama is running (`ollama serve`)

- Check that the specified model is installed (`ollama pull model-name`)

**Permission errors**
- Ensure Obsidian has write permissions to destination folder
